                    <font size="-1">
                        In 1922, Mordell conjectured that every curve of genus at least 2 has only finitely many rational points and this was later proved by Faltings in 1983. However, in 1941, Chabauty proved that Mordell's conjecture is true with the additional hypothesis that the Mordell-Weil rank of the Jacobian variety over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is strictly less that the genus of the curve. Although this doesn't prove Mordell's conjecture in full generality, Chabauty's ideas lead to the creation of new methods for finding rational points on curves. After proving Chabauty's result and its improvement by Coleman (1985), we will explicitely solve some diophantine equations.

Supervisor: prof. <a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~schoof/">Ren√© Schoof</a><br>
                    <font size="-1">After introducing the general theory of elliptic curves over \( \mathbb{Q}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}_p\), I investigated the existence and the number of integer solutions of the equations \(\frac{x}{y+z}+\frac{y}{x+z}+\frac{z}{x+y}=N\) and 
                    \(\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} = N\) with \(N \in \mathbb{Z}\). This was done by exhibiting explicit bijections between the integer solutions of the equations and the set of rational points of two elliptc curves (whose coefficients depend on \(N\)), and then using the well-known theory to 
                    find the rational points of those curves. Furthermore, the existence of special solutions (e.g. solutions with \(x, y, z > 0\)) is studied with the same method.</font>
